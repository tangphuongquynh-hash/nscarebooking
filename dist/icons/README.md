Place icon image files here (PNG, SVG, or JPG). Filenames used by the app (recommended):

- industrial-cleaning.png
- curtain-carpet-sofa.png
- tea-lady.png
- hard-spot-cleaning.png
- ac-cleaning.png
- full-house-cleaning.png

Each icon should be square (e.g. 64x64 or 128x128) and have a transparent background if possible. The app will try to load `/icons/<name>.png` and will fall back to an emoji if the image is not found.
